## Filter library

This script is used to filter the library generated by MZmine3 workflow.

It filters the library based on precursor check, core adduct check, ion dependency check, modcos match, and isobaric mass check using uniquely existed adducts.


### Usage

1. work in an environment with the following packages installed: numpy, pandas, matchms, molmass
```commandline
pip install numpy pandas matchms molmass
```

2. prepare the library files (**mgf** & **tsv**, generated by MZmine3 workflow) in the `input` folder.

3. prepare the compound **csv** table (used for MZmine3 library generation workflow) in the `input` folder.

4. run the script
```commandline
python filter_library.py
```

### Note
The underscore `_` should be removed from individual compound names, and only used in conjugated compounds.

For example: `Phenylalanine_cholic acid` is the conjugated compound of `Phenylalanine` and `cholic acid`.

If `_` exists in individual compound names, it should be replaced with `-`. e.g., `L_alanine` -> `L-alanine`.
