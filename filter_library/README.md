## Filter library

This script is used to filter the library generated by MZmine3 workflow.

It filters the library based on precursor check, core adduct check, ion dependency check, modcos match, and isobaric mass check using uniquely existed adducts.


### Usage

You can directly use the jupyter notebook `filter_library.ipynb` to run the script.


- Preparation:
  - library files (**mgf** & **tsv**, generated by MZmine3 workflow) in the `input` folder.
  - compound **csv** table (used for MZmine3 library generation workflow) in the `input` folder.


### Note
The underscore `_` should be removed from individual compound names, and only used in conjugated compounds.

For example: `Phenylalanine_cholic acid` is the conjugated compound of `Phenylalanine` and `cholic acid`.

If `_` exists in individual compound names, it should be replaced with `-`. e.g., `L_alanine` -> `L-alanine`.
