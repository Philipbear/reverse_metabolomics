## Filter library

This script is used to filter the library generated by MZmine3 workflow.

It filters the library based on core adduct check, ion dependency check, modcos match, and isobaric mass check.


### Usage

if you are more familiar with jupyter notebook, you can use the [filter_library.ipynb](filter_library.ipynb) to run the script.

1. work in an environment with the following packages installed: numpy, pandas, matchms
```commandline
pip install numpy pandas matchms
```

2. prepare the library files (mgf & tsv, generated by MZmine3 workflow) in the 'input' folder.

3. run the script
```commandline
python filter_library.py
```
