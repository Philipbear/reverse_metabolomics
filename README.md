# reverse_metabolomics

All the required codes are included in this GitHub repository, such that further updates can be easily tracked.

The entire SOP for reverse metabolomics is [available here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jvLTQ_gbU6-ljOjG2v-6W_8KIpOSBRT5cJthqHA_TB0/edit?usp=sharing).


## generate_smiles
This is used to generate SMILES data using reactants.


## filter_library
This is used to filter the library generated by MZmine3 workflow.

* input: 
  * **mgf** file & **tsv** file (output from MZmine3)
  * **csv** file (compound table for MZmine3 input)
* output
  * filtered **mgf** file & **tsv** file, ready for GNPS upload
